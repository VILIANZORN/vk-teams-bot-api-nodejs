# VK Teams Bot API for Node.js **(unofficial)**

### [<img src="logo_msg.png" width="16"> VK Teams API Specification](https://teams.vk.com/botapi/)

## Getting started

* Create your own bot by sending the _/newbot_ command to _Metabot_ and follow the instructions.
    >Note: a bot can only reply after the user has added it to his contact list, or if the user was the first to start a dialogue.
* You can configure the domain that hosts your VK Teams server. When instantiating the Bot class, add the address of your domain.
* An example of how to use the framework can be seen in _example/test_bot.py_

## Installing

Install using npm:
```bash
npm install mailru-im-bot-unofficial
```

## Project Features

This is an unofficial version for node.js, as there is no official one. It is derived from the python version from the commit https://github.com/mail-ru-im/bot-python/commit/db4fd9318e116a1a1c45bff0f76fb6b9b27bb604
and converted to node.js using ChatGPT
